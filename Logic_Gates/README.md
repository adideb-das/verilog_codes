# Logic Gates in Verilog

Following are the verilog code for all seven logic gates( AND, OR , NOT, NAND, NOR , XOR, XNOR)



## Deployment

To deploy this project clone this github repository and extract the files to VS Code. 

Navigate to the particular logic gate folder and open a new terminal window 

```
  iverilog -o sim xxx_gate_tb.v
```
where sim is the simulation output and xxx is either of the seven logic gates. 

If you wish to simulate the timing diagram of AND gate , enter 
```
iverilog -o sim and_gate_tb.v
```
A simulation output of sim is created as the output file . To generate the timing diagram of sim , enter 
```
vvp sim
```
A timing diagram of xxx_gate.vcd will be generated as timing diagram file. We can view it in GTKWave using the following command
```
gtkwave xxx_gate.vcd
```
If we wish to simulate AND gate , then following command is given
```
gtkwave and_gate.vcd
```
A timing diagram will be generated by GTKwave Analyser. We can analyse the output signals as per our requirement.
